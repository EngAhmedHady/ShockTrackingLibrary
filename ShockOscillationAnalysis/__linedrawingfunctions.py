def XCheck(x,Shp,slope,a):
    """
    Check and calculate the image boundary y-coordinate based on the given x-coordinate and slope.

    This function takes an x-coordinate, image shape parameters (Shp), slope, and intercept (a) as inputs,
    and calculates the corresponding y-coordinate (p2) based on the specified conditions.

    Parameters:
    - x (float): The x-coordinate to be checked.
    - Shp (tuple): A tuple containing shape parameters (Shp[0] for y-axis limit, Shp[1] for x-axis limit).
    - slope (float): The slope of the line.
    - a (float): The y-intercept of the line.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple (p2) representing the calculated point (x, y).

    Example:
    >>> instance = YourClass()
    >>> result = instance.XCheck(2.5, (10, 5), 2, 3)
    >>> print(result)
    (2.5, 8)

    Note:
    - If x is within the range [0, Shp[1]], the y-coordinate is calculated based on the line equation.
    - If x is greater than Shp[1], the y-coordinate is calculated at the point (Shp[1], y2), where y2 is determined by the line equation.
    - If x is less than 0, the y-coordinate is calculated at the point (0, y2), where y2 is determined by the line equation.

def InclinedLine(P1, P2 = (), slope = None, imgShape = ()):
    """
    Generates the inclined line equation from two points or one point and slope.

    The image boundary/shape should be given.

    Parameters:
    - P1 (tuple): First point tuple (a1, b1).
    - P2 (tuple, optional): Second point tuple (a2, b2). Defaults to ().
    - slope (float, optional): Slope of the line. Defaults to None.
    - imgShape (tuple): Image size (y-length, x-length).

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
    - first boundary point tuple.
    - second boundary point tuple.
    - line slope.
    - y-intercept.

    Example:
    >>> instance = YourClass()
    >>> result = instance.InclinedLine((0, 0), (2, 4), imgShape=(5, 5))
    >>> print(result)
    ((0, 0), (5, 5), 1.0, 0)

    Note:
    - If `imgShape` is not provided, the function prints an error message and aborts the program.
    - If only one point (`P1`) and slope (`slope`) are provided, the function calculates the second point.
    - If the line is not vertical or horizontal, it calculates the boundary points based on the image shape.
    - If the line is vertical, the slope is `np.inf`, and the function returns vertical boundary points.
    - If the line is horizontal, the slope is 0, and the function returns horizontal boundary points.
